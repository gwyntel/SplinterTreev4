fix: resolve cog loading issues and prevent duplicates

- Add cogs_setup_complete flag to prevent multiple setup attempts
- Add unload_all_cogs() function to properly clean up before reloading
- Add safety check for loaded_cogs before random selection
- Prevent multiple status updater initializations
- Improve error handling and logging for cog loading process

This fixes the "Extension already loaded" errors and ensures cogs are properly managed during reconnections.
