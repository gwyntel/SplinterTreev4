refactor: use OpenPipeAI client for all API requests

- Removed AsyncOpenAI dependency
- Use OpenPipeAI client for both OpenPipe and OpenRouter requests
- Maintain all existing functionality including streaming and logging
- Keep store=true parameter for OpenPipe requests
- Keep detailed debug logging

This change simplifies the API client dependencies while maintaining all functionality.
