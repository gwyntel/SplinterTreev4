fix: correct async generator syntax in API

Fixed SyntaxError in api.py where we were trying to return None from async generators. In Python, async generators (functions that use 'yield') cannot use 'return value'. Changed to:
- Yield empty string instead of returning None for no content
- Yield error messages instead of raising exceptions in streaming mode
- Improved error handling and logging for both OpenRouter and OpenPipe requests

This should resolve the cog loading errors and allow all models to function properly.
