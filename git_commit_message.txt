fix: update context commands with backward compatibility

- Add slash command versions of all context commands
- Maintain backward compatibility with legacy !summarize commands
- Add proper DM channel permission handling for both command types
- Add proper permission checks for guild channels
- Add command descriptions and parameter descriptions
- Fix system prompt variable rendering in base_cog.py
- Add shared logic handler for summarize commands

This allows users to use both slash commands and legacy commands while fixing permission issues.
