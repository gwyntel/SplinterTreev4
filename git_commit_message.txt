- Add message trigger checking to prevent all cogs from processing every message
- Remove redundant on_message handlers from model cogs
- Update trigger words to avoid overlaps between Claude models
- Fix OpenPipe API integration by removing unsupported 'store' parameter
- Make model names consistent with temperatures.json
- Improve error handling and logging
