fix: improve Hermes message handling

Updated Hermes cog to properly handle message history and context variables:
- Added proper context variable formatting for system prompts
- Included message history in API requests (last 5 messages)
- Improved error logging for better debugging
- Maintained compatibility with base cog functionality

This should help resolve issues with Hermes not responding by ensuring it has proper context and message history.
