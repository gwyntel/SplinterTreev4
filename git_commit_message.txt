fix: enhance API logging for OpenRouter requests

Added detailed logging for OpenRouter API requests to help diagnose why Hermes returns null:
- Added request data logging before API calls
- Added response tracking in streaming mode
- Added error logging with full request details
- Improved error handling and reporting
- Added null response detection in streaming mode

This will help identify exactly where and why the Hermes requests are failing.
