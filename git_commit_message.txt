fix: Add missing generate_response method to BaseCog

The generate_response method was missing from BaseCog, causing response generation to fail. Added implementation that:
- Gets message history for context
- Formats system prompts with current context
- Handles both text and image inputs
- Supports streaming responses
- Works with both OpenRouter and OpenPipe providers

This fix ensures all cogs inheriting from BaseCog can properly generate responses without needing to implement their own generate_response method.
