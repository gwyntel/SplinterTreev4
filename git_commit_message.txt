feat: Add legacy command support for channel activation

- Added !activate and !deactivate legacy commands
- Refactored activation logic into common handler
- Updated help documentation to show both slash and legacy commands
- Improved code organization in management_cog.py

This maintains backwards compatibility while providing modern slash command alternatives.
