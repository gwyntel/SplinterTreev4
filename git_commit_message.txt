fix: correct OpenRouter API headers handling

The previous fix broke OpenRouter by trying to pass headers as a parameter to AsyncCompletions.create(). Instead:
1. Moved headers to aiohttp.ClientSession initialization
2. Removed headers from individual API calls
3. Simplified API endpoint handling
4. Improved error logging

This should properly fix the OpenRouter integration while maintaining all required headers.
