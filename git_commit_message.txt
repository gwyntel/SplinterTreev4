feat: Add channel activation controls

- Added /activate and /deactivate commands to control bot message processing per channel
- Added deactivated_channels table to track channel status
- Updated base_cog to check channel activation before processing messages
- Updated help command and README with new features
- Commands require channel management or message management permissions

This allows server moderators to control which channels the bot responds in, providing better control over bot usage across different channels.
