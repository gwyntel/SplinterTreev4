fix: add case-insensitive prompt lookup in base_cog.py

- Add case-insensitive prompt lookup in load_prompt()
- Try exact match first, then case-insensitive match
- Finally try normalized match (removing special characters)

This ensures prompts are found regardless of case or special characters in cog names.
